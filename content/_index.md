# subtitle: Excited about any kind of work involving robotics and automation,particularly in the field of perception and planning.
subtitle: I am currently getting my Master's degree in Robotic Systems Development at Carnegie Mellon University and will be graduating in May 2020. Through my education, I have gained the ability to design and implement robotic system involving hardware as well as software.                                                                              During my bachelor in Mechanical Engineering at the University of Arizona, I learned the basic skills to design such systems through extensive coursework in dynamics, CAD, controls and programming. I have also gained hands-on experience through projects, one of which is shown below.                                                                      I have then decided to earn my Master's degree at the Robotics Institute at Carnegie Mellon University and to focus more on the software part of robotics. I have been and still am deepening my knowledge in key areas, such as Computer Vision, Planning and Controls, and apply it in hands-on projects.  
tagline: Below are some of my projects that I am thrilled to share with you. Feel free to browse through all the available descriptions and media.
