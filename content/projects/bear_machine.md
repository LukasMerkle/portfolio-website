The goal of this project was to design a test bench that simulates the wear of an airplane's landing gear bearing when it lands. This wear is caused by two main things: During landing, the landing gear compresses and a large rod slides along the bearing. Due to the landing impact, there is also a large radial load applied on the bearing. The combination of the two causes wear and the bearing has to be switched out after a certain amount of cycles. However, the number of cycles is hard to estimate by theoretical analysis, which explains the need for this test bench.
