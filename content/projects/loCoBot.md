The main goal of this project is to assemble a specified structure, such as a wall, by using a UAV equipped with a manipulator. This system will compete in the third challenge of the MBZIRC competition in Abu Dhabi in February 2020. It makes use of a Hexcopter running Pixhawk as a flight controller, a Nuc as the main computer and a costomed designed manipulator arm attached at the bottom of the drone.
