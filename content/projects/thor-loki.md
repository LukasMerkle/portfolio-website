highlights: 
- Stayed on-campus over the summer to work on robot software in preparation for the 2016 RoboSub competition in July, in which we achieved 3rd place internationally 
- Implemented computer vision and high-level control software to identify targets labeled with letters, remove a physical cover from a target, and shoot plastic projectiles at targets with specified letters

CUAUV was my first experience working on a relatively complex
robotics project, an underwater robot with a 50-person team
consisting of about 15 software team members. (I had competed in high
school robotics, but I was leading a relatively small 3-person team.)
The objective of CUAUV is 
to produce a robot to compete in the international RoboSub
competition. The competition consists of a series of tasks of varying
difficulty, which a fully
autonomous robot can choose to complete in order to gain points. As a team member, I developed an interest
in computer vision, researching topics such as graph-based image
segmentation to enable object detection invariant to lighting
conditions and visual egomotion in order to caculate velocity without
an expensive sonar sensor. I implemented simple proof-of-concept prototype
algorithms for both of these. 

As the competition takes in July, some team members opt to stay
on-campus over the summer to work on the robot. I opted to stay
during Summer 2016 as a sophmore. I worked extensively on computer vision algorithms
and high-level state machine and control logic to
to complete the "Torpedoes" task at RoboSub 2016. The task consisted of
identifing targets labeled with letters, removing a physical cover from a target, 
and shooting plastic projectiles at targets with specified letters.
I spent nearly all of my time
that summer writing computer vision code, testing and collecting logs in the pool,
and revising and re-desgining code as needed to account for new failure
modes, re-running against the collected log data, and finally
re-testing in the pool.

I had a fantastic experience attending RoboSub 2016, speaking with
other teams about how they had approached the challenges and watching
my code manuver the vehicle around the obstacle course. I was super
excited when our team acheived third place.
